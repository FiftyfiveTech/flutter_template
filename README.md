[![N|Solid](https://www.fiftyfivetech.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/logo.png)](https://nodesource.com/products/nsolid)

 ✨ This repository showing that how we are using clean code architecture, folder structure, and component reusability.✨

## Features

- _**Functionality**_  : Work correctly, efficiently, and robustly.
- _**Readability**_    : The primary audience for our code is other developers.
-  _**Extensibility**_ : Well-designed code should be extensible as a building block for solving new problems.
- _**Scalability**_    : The code that can scale along with the need of your business.
- _**Testability**_    : Isolated and modularised code without dependencies, well testable at unit level.

## Tech

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) - an open source framework by Google for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase.
- [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/) - a reactive caching and data binding framework.
- [Flutter Hooks](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_hooks) - better lifecycle management and component (widget) reusability.
